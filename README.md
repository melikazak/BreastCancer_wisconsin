# Breast Cancer Tumor Type Clasification Problem
The dataset was uploaded to the UCI Machine Learning Repository by Nick Street in 1995, available at https://data.world/health/breast-cancer-wisconsin <br />
The dataset contains 569 rows and 32 columns: <br />
The 'id' column is a cardinal feature <br />
The 'diagnosis' column is the target feature consisting of 2 categories: 'M' referring to Malignant tumor type, and 'B' referring to benign tumor type. <br />
Other 30 features were computed from a digitized image of a breast mass's fine needle aspirate (FNA). <br />
Mean, SE, and Worst Values regarding ten numerical features computed from images as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension are shown in 30 columns in this tabular dataset. <br />
<br />
This project is a classification machine learning task to predict breast cancer tumor type.
